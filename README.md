This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer.  The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to assign a value to a memory location pointed to by a null pointer. This leads to undefined behavior, typically resulting in a segmentation fault or a crash.  The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version that avoids this error.
